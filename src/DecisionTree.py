@brief The class implements a single decision trees.

@details
Although the adopted implementation does not provide any advantage when considering software implementations, this 
class implements a decision tree using the speculative approach proposed in Amato F, Barbareschi M, Casola V, Mazzeo A,
Romano S "Towards automatic generation of hardware classifiers". International Conference on Algorithms and
Architectures for Parallel Processing. Springer, Cham, pp 125â€“132
In this way, it is possible to mimic more effectively the effects that precision-scaling and functional approximation
techniques have on the model used for the final hardware implementation.

The speculative approach consists in a DT flattening so that the visiting is performed over every possible path.
In particular, each DT node contains a condition that establishes if the visiting has to continue on left sub-tree or on
right sub-tree, until a leaf is reached. Instead, in the speculative approach, predicates are performed concurrently,
regardless of the position and depth at which nodes are located: a Boolean decision variable, which indicates whether a
condition is fulfilled, is produced for each one of the evaluated predicates. In order to determine which leaf of the
DT is reached, i.e., which class the input belongs to, a Boolean function, called assertion, is defined for each
different class. Since a path that leads to a specific leaf is obtained by computing the logic-AND between the Boolean
decision variables along that path, and since it is possible to compute the logic OR between the conditions related to
different paths leading to leaves belonging to the same class, assertions can be defined as a sum of products Boolean
functions. 

As mentioned, this class also allows to apply the precision scaling and functional AIG-rewriting approximate-computing
techniques on feature values representation and assertion functions, respectively, in order to reduce hardware
requirements of the final hardware implementation.
